Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

src/

Components/: Defines the application pages/routes.
App.js: Entry point for the React application.
index.js: Renders the React application and sets up routing.

Features
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete records.
Navigation: Utilizes React Navigation for routing within the application.
Styling: Combines React-Bootstrap and Semantic UI for a visually appealing user interface.
